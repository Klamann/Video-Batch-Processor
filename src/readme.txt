Notes:
This application will create a folder named ".vbp" in your user home directory.
In this folder a file "settings.ini" will be created to store your previous
configuration. If you want to remove any traces of this software on your local
data storage device, just remove the ".vbp"-folder.

On Windows operating systems, this folder can usually be found under
C:\Users\<yourname>\.vbp\
On Unix-like operating systems it's usually /home/<yourname>/.vbp/
